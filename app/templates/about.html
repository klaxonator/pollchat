        <h4><strong>WHAT’S THE POINT?</strong></h4>
        <p>
        PollChatter is driven by a simple idea: that we, as voters and participants in
        a democratic society, should be able to understand who is trying to influence us,
        and why.
        </p>
        <p>
        We can’t tell you who people really are on Twitter. Nor do we want to.
        There ought to be some privacy in this world.
        </p>
        <p>
        But we can show you trends. Across districts, across screen names, across
        hashtags. If anyone’s trying to move the political needle (and we all know they
        are), there’s a chance it might show up here.
        </p>
        <p>
        So: click around and see what’s happening. And then go out and
        shake the world up.
        </p>

        <h4><strong>WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON?</strong></h4>

        We’ll let Kenzaburo Oe (<a href="

        oe-the-art-of-fiction-no-195-kenzaburo-oe">read him</a>!
         read everybody!) take the question:
        </p>
        <p>
        <blockquote>
            “I am an anarchist who loves democracy.”
        </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
        Draw your own conclusions.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4><strong>WHAT’S THE LONG GAME?</strong></h4>
        <p>
        We live in a big-data society. It is very clearly not an information democracy.
        So what to do?
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Fight data with data</strong>, is our idea. It’s probably not good
        physics, but until someone has a better idea, we’ll keep coding.
